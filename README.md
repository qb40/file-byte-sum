**filebytesum** is a dos app to find the byte sum of a file to verify its integrity.
Such a requirement in case of communication as well as storage (storage can be considered
as communication where source is current you and destination is a later you). Communication
is almost always lossy, and can introduce errors into data. A measure like this helps to
verify the correctness of data (but cannot guarentee that it is correct). More details
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum).
